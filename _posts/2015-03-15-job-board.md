<h4>Onboarding the user</h4>
<p>
  In this setup example, let's assume the user finds/sees an advertisement for the service, which includes the number and the instructions <em>"Text START to Start looking for or listing a job!"</em>
</p>

<div class="sms-row">
  <div class="small-preview">
    <h5>User</h5>
    <div class="sms-window">
      START
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="small-preview">
    <h5>Service</h5>
    <div class="sms-window service">
      Welcome to the Job board! <br><br>
      To list a job, reply with LISTJOB. <br><br>
      To look for jobs reply with LOOKFORJOB <br><br>
      For help, reply with HELP

#### Listing a Job
In an ideal setting, the job board should exist both online and via SMS. This is why the Job listing process is structured in the same way as a form, with the data that will be relevant for searchability grouped in one input.

The 160 character limit does mean that it is difficult to not break up the process into multiple steps. However, if the user does not need to change anything in their listing, they will "only" send 7 SMS. 

Perhaps the solution would be to allow them to quicklist with one message, however it presents some problems in how the data would be interpreted by the database and could prevent jobseekers from filtering jobs properly.

<h4>
  Looking for a Job
</h4>
<p>
  The main benefit we try to offer in this user flow is the ability to seek out jobs that are targeted to the users skills and preferences. It focuses on <i>location</i>, <i>job role</i> & <i>salary</i>
</p>
<p>
  The system should ideally be able to smartmatch keywords even if they are not identical.

### The user flows outlined above are not final, but present a groundwork for interesting SMS services.

What this project considers the most important is the shift in thinking - that it is possible to translate internet usefullness into the very low-fi interaction of SMS. It only requires the hosting party to have the computational power.
